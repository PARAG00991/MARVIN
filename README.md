Just another conversation bot
-----------------------------
This bot (also called Marvin) will be able to carry conversation with the user,
providing all kind of information in a casual way. No syntax details,
summarised information, in plain English are its main characterstics. 


Running locally

It's not published, or going to be published soon. To test the features, one
needs to download source, and try this on Microsoft's
[bot emulator framework](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases):

* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rahul-raturi/marvin`
* `$ cd marvin`
* `npm install`

**Note:** The bot is in the starting stage of development. I will enable issues
section when I feel like it.
